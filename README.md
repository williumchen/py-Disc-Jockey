# py-Disc-Jockey
*Abbreviated as py-DJ.*

py-DJ is a free domain-specific language for quickly editting audio files in a way that is intuitive and easy to learn, with the eventual goal of making audio-mixing more user friendly. py-DJ is a command-line interface that is entirely text-based. py-DJ offers support for basic features (volume adjustment, pitch adjustment, and concatenation of files), and will be later expanded to be more feature-rich.
